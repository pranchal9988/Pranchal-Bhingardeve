Predicting Property prices based on various factors using Regression analysis.

The project aims to predict the sale price of properties based on various factors using multiple regression techniques, including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net. The project's ultimate goal is to develop an accurate predictive model that can be used by real estate professionals and investors to make informed decisions about buying and selling properties.

To achieve this goal, the project will begin by gathering a comprehensive dataset of property features, such as location, size, age, number of bedrooms, and amenities. The dataset will also include historical sales data, which will serve as the target variable for the regression models.

Using the gathered dataset, the project will implement each of the regression techniques mentioned above and compare their performance. Linear regression will serve as the baseline model, while Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net will be used to improve model performance by addressing issues such as overfitting and multicollinearity.

Once the models have been developed and tested, the project will evaluate their predictive accuracy using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared. The model with the highest accuracy will be selected and presented as the final product of the project.

Overall, the project's success will be measured by its ability to develop an accurate predictive model that can be utilized by real estate professionals and investors to make informed decisions about buying and selling properties. By doing so, the project will provide valuable insights into the factors that affect property sales prices and help stakeholders in the real estate industry to make more informed decisions.
